I was able to complete most of problem #1 during this week's iteration. 

My front and side views are the same right now, but I plan to add details to make them distinct.

I was unable to submit last night due to a family emergency. I do not have any documentation to prove this because (thankfully) no hospitals or law enforcement were involved, but I do completely understand Professor Haim's policy involving late submissions and documentation, so I understand if I am not able to recieve credit for this submission.
